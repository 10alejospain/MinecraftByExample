New stuff:
RenderType: solid, cutout mipped, etc
RenderTypeLookup manually sets the render type for each block now

A clue to the OverlayTexture (CombinedOverlay) is in

LivingRenderer:

public static int getPackedOverlay (LivingEntity entity, float uIn)

uIn appears to be partial ticks?

   public static int func_229117_c_(LivingEntity p_229117_0_, float p_229117_1_) {
      return OverlayTexture.func_229201_a_(OverlayTexture.func_229199_a_(p_229117_1_), OverlayTexture.func_229202_a_(p_229117_0_.hurtTime > 0 || p_229117_0_.deathTime > 0));
   }

 OverlayTexture.func_229201_a_ getPackedUV

The overlay texture is
grid:
i<8 ->  B200 00FF  RED
i>=8 -> linear interpolate 64-255 << 24 OR 00FF FFFF

Tags for grouping types of objects together eg crops, leaves, wool
eg for leaves tag:
data.minecraft.tags.blocks.leaves.json contains a list of all the blocks which receive this tag

Minecraft state:
IntegerProperty, BooleanProperty, DirectionProperty, EnumProperty

BlockState has a large number of methods to determine capabilities

Couple of notes regarding (ticking) mod tile entities:

Be sure that your TE implements ITickableTileEntity and not ITickable. If you don't, you won't see any errors, but your TE won't tick.
When registering your TE, be sure to pass all the blocks for that TE (most likely just one block, but can be multiple) to the TileEntityType.Builder.create() method. Again, if you don't - no errors, but no ticking (and no rendering, if you're using a TESR). Probably good practice to do this for every TE regardless.

There's a new BlockRayTraceResult class which is used in several place to aggregate some parameters. E.g. ItemUseContext and BlockUseContext constructors, ItemStack.onItemUseFirst() etc.

sOpaqueCube => remove, mc now checks this with the block's voxelshape
