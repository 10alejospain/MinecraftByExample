The classes in this directory are only used for testing mbe81b, you can safely ignore them.  The code for mbe81b is sufficiently complex that I have created a number of automated tests to make sure it all works correctly, rather than manually testing it.

How to execute the tests:<br>
use custom command /mbedebug test TEST_NUMBER<br>
eg /mbedebug test 35<br>

Tests:
8100 = test all 
8101 = test the BoomerangFlightPath class
