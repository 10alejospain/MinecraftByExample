MBE13_ITEM_TOOLS

This example shows some of the key ways that you can control how tools work


This example is just a very simple item - an ordinary two-dimension item that does nothing at all.
It will show you
1) how to create an Item class and register it
2) how to define and register the model for rendering the Item

The pieces you need to understand are located in:
Startup
ItemSimple
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\lang\en_US.lang - for the displayed name of the item
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\item\mbe10_item_simple - for the model used to render the item
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\textures\items\mbe10_item_simple_icon.png - texture used for the item.

The item will appear in the Miscellaneous tab in the creative inventory.

--------
Common errors:
"Missing Model", "Missing texture", etc:
These are caused when you have specified a filename or path which is not correct, typically:
1) you've misspelled it
2) the upper/lower case doesn't match
3) you've forgotten the resource domain, eg "blockmodel" instead of "minecraftbyexample:blockmodel"
4) the folder structure of your assets folders is incorrect
5) If using IntelliJ 14 - the assets isn't be copied to the right place, you need to apply a fix to your build.gradle,

-------------
Item:
canHarvestBlock
getHarvestLevel / setHarvestLevel
getToolClasses
getDigSpeed
getStrVsBlock
onBlockStartBreak (cancellable)

ItemTool
Item.ToolMaterial
ItemTool(effectiveBlocks)

-the tool constructor provides a set of blocks that it is "effective on".
-when a tool is effective on a block, it operates with efficiency according to its material, otherwise "1.0F"

ItemStack
"CanDestroy" tag (vanilla doesn't use?) in ItemStack NBT  (adventure mode)



-



Block:
getHarvestLeve / setHarvestLevel
getHarvestTool
(one tool only per metadata)
isToolEffective
getBlockHardness / setBlockHardness (vanilla constructors)
Resistance is something else (explosion?)
getPlayerRelativeBlockHardness


Material
isToolNotRequired


classes:
"pickaxe"
"axe"
"shovel"
or null

ForgeHooks.canToolHarvestBlock
ForgeHooks.blockStrength()
 .isToolEffective
canHarvestBlock

EntityPlayer.getBreakSpeed
 .getToolDigEfficiency
  EnchantmentHelper.getEfficiencyModifier

PlayerEvent.BreakSpeed
PlayerEvent.HarvestCheck

PlayerControllerMP has a lot of the code



harvest level tool >= harvest level block

adventure mode?


     * @param toolClass Class
     * @param level Harvest level:
     *     Wood:    0
     *     Stone:   1
     *     Iron:    2
     *     Diamond: 3
     *     Gold:    0
