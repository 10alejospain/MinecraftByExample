MBE35_RECIPES

This example is a collection of the different types of recipes in the game
It will show you
1) how to create recipes for the crafting table
2) how to use "ore dictionary" recipes for the crafting table
3) how to create recipes for the furnace ("smelting")
4) how to add a "fuel" value for your items when burnt in a furnace
5) how to add your own IRecipe class for complicated crafting logic

In earlier versions, recipes had to be added by code.  now they can be added by json as well.
This example shows both.

The pieces you need to understand are located in:
StartupCommon

For json recipes:
resources.assets.minecraftbyexample.recipes.mbe35_recipe_painting.json
TODO **** NOT CURRENTLY WORKING ****

For pictures of the recipes being added, see http://greyminecraftcoder.blogspot.com/2015/02/recipes.html

Useful discussion about recipes, especially the new json :

The names of vanilla Items can be found in the Items class (see the static initialiser at the bottom)
