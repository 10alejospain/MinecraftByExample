BUGGY.  Can't be used for this as written.


Some notes on how the customised rendering works

1) When the block is about to be rendered, vanilla uses the block ModelResourceLocation "mbe06c_block_redstone_meter" to
 retrieve the IBlockModel from the model registry.  In this case, we have previously used ModelBakeEventHandler to
 insert our RedstoneMeterISmartBlockModelFactory into the registry.
2) Since RedstoneMeterISmartBlockModel implements ISmartBlockModel, forge then calls BlockRedstoneMeter.getExtendedState(),
  which calculates the redstone power level and stores it in IExtendedBlockState
3) Forge then passes IExtendedBlockState to the RedstoneMeterISmartBlockModelFactory, which creates an appropriate
   IBakedModel (RedstoneMeterSmartBlockModel) and returns it.
4) Finally, the rendering methods call RedstoneMeterSmartBlockModel to find out what faces should be rendered.
