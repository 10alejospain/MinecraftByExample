todo: need to rethink this
- these utility classes need to
1) provide a way to spawn the desired plant at the desired location
2) identify the plant from an iBlockState and place it at another location if suitable.

First is easy - use the appropriate Spawner with the type information as appropriate - no need to unify these
Second - the block chooses the appropriate class, and the class then looks at the iBlockState to identify the
  relevant type
This is done using the main type to generate sub-types

Registration of all types is done by the main utility which calls each class in turn

potato
carrot
wheat
sugarcane

BlockPotato, BLockCarrot = BlockCrops
wheat = BlockCrops direct.
